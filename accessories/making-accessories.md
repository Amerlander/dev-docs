# Using the Edge Connector

The micro:bit card edge connector, commonly referred to as the 'edge connector' or the pins is designed to make accessory design easy. Many common micro:bit accessories work by placing a female edge connector on the board. However, there are limitations to the current that can be drawn from the micro:bit, and accessories must be designed carefully to ensure they do not damage the micro:bit, or that the micro:bit cannot damage them.

# Battery Pads

There are two lozenge shaped pads on the back of the micro:bit. These allow you to connect a battery holder via a mechanism other than the JST connector.

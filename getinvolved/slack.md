# Get Involved

The micro:bit community is already spread across the world, building cool things
with micro:bits and building the software that runs on them. With the release of the
micro:bit reference design, we hope to see a range of new contributors interested
in the hardware side of things too.

If you'd like to be part of the world-wide micro:bit community, then join us on
the microbit-community slack channel!

<a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> is a messaging service that allows teams and communities to connect online. It's a brilliant tool for live collaboration and the place to be for current micro:bit chatter! Please note that Slack complements, but does not replace our <a href="http://support.microbit.org/"> Support Site</a>, where you can search for help and ask the team questions.

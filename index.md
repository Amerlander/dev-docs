# Half wiki, half datasheet
This site aims to sit between a community wiki and a technical data sheet for
the micro:bit.

Like a wiki, it is written, maintained and improved by the micro:bit community,
however as changes must be submitted as GitHub Pull Requests, we aim to have
strong curation and ensure that the information on the site remains up-to-date
and factually correct.

You can edit any of the pages here by clicking the 'edit' icon in the header bar
![edit icon](assets/index-0a517.png)

If you'd rather just 'report an issue' you can do that with the same link.

# The micro:bit Educational Foundation and upstream communities

This site is run by the micro:bit Educational Foundation in order to document the
hardware and software that make the micro:bit work the way it does. By doing so,
we hope to encourage contributions into all of the projects that are used in order
to build the ecosystem, ultimately broadening the range of things people can invent
with a micro:bit, and making each step of invention easier.

The micro:bit Educational Foundation aims to be a 'responsible downstream' to the
many open source software projects that are used to build the micro:bit:  much like
a good Linux distribution collates, tests, stabilises and releases combinations of
many diverse open source packages, the micro:bit Educational Foundation and the
micro:bit community present micro:bit users with a stable, tested release of all
the things you need to make the magical 'end-to-end' micro:bit experience.

# Help us build it

If you'd like to help us make the micro:bit better, then there are a number of
ways that you can get involved

* Contribute features and fixes to one of the upstream projects that the micro:bit relies upon,
such as the micro:bit Runtime, pxt, the Python editor, or mbed. These projects are
explained in this site.
* Help us build a brilliant hardware ecosystem around micro:bit - derivative boards,
cool accessories and add ons, or even suggestions for future versions of the micro:bit.
The micro:bit schematic is available [here](/hardware/schematic/) and for making
your own project the [reference design](/hardware/reference-design) is a good place to start
* Improve the documentation and this site, which is hosted on GitHub, either reporting issues
or adding documentation will be extremely helpful
* Help build a community around micro:bit - join the [slack channel](/get-involved/where-to-find/),
share the things you've created on twitter, blog about them!
